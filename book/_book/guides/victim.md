# User Guide

This guide walks individuals through submitting evidence safely and receiving updates about their case. It is written in plain language so volunteers can share it directly with users.

## Before You Begin

- Gather any screenshots, chat logs, emails, or receipts related to the suspected scam.
- Remove or redact information you do not wish to share; i4g will automatically mask sensitive data after upload.
- Sign in with a Google account if prompted. (We currently rely on Google Identity Platform while we evaluate more accessible IAM options for broader communities.)

## Submit a Case

1. Visit the i4g intake page (placeholder: `https://user.intelligenceforgood.org` – update when domains are finalized).
2. Read the consent statement outlining how the data will be used for analysis and reporting.
3. Provide contact information so an analyst can follow up. This information is tokenized and stored separately.
4. Upload evidence files or paste text conversations. Supported formats include `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.heic`.
5. Describe the situation in your own words, including approximate dates and any monetary losses.
6. Submit the form and note your **Case ID** for future reference.

## After Submission

- You will receive a confirmation email with your Case ID and a summary of what happens next.
- Analysts aim to review cases within 3 business days. Times may vary during pilot phases.
- You can reply to the confirmation email (or future secure portal) to add more evidence.
- When the review is complete, you will receive either:
  - Educational guidance and next steps if the risk is low, or
  - A link to download a law enforcement-ready report if escalation is warranted.

## Privacy & Safety

- Sensitive information (names, phone numbers, SSNs, bank accounts) is **never shown** to volunteer analysts. It is replaced with secure tokens (e.g., `<PII:PHONE:abcd123>`).
- Only administrators with dual control can rehydrate PII when generating official reports or responding to law enforcement requests.
- If you submitted information in error, contact `support@intelligenceforgood.org` with your Case ID and we will purge the data.

## Need Immediate Assistance?

If you believe you are in immediate danger or have already suffered financial loss, contact your local authorities right away and inform your bank. i4g complements official support channels but does not replace emergency services.
