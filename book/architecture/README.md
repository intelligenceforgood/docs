# Architecture

The i4g platform is built on a modular, cloud-native stack that balances rapid iteration with strict data protections. This section highlights the topology, data pipelines, and infrastructure tooling that make the system operate at nonprofit scale.

- [System Topology](system-topology.md) outlines the end-to-end architecture and major components.
- [Data Pipelines](data-pipeline.md) follows evidence from ingestion through reporting.
- [Infrastructure & Deployment](infra.md) covers Terraform modules, Cloud Run services, and network configuration.

Refer to the `infra` repository for the authoritative Terraform code and the `proto` repository for application services and migration scripts.
