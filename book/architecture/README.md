# Architecture Guide

This guide gives end users a plain-language map of how Intelligence for Good processes evidence, protects privacy, and produces reports. For technical details, see the developer docs in the core repository; this book stays high-level and visual.

- **[System Topology](system-topology.md)**: One-page “metro map” of user app, analyst console, API, and evidence vault. _(Insert diagram image placeholder here)_
- **[Data Pipeline](data-pipeline.md)**: How uploads become searchable cases and signed reports. _(Insert pipeline image placeholder here)_
- **[Security Model](security-model.md)**: How we keep data private (tokenization, access rules, auditing) in simple terms.

> Note: Infrastructure and deployment details are kept in internal engineering docs; this section focuses on concepts that matter to end users and partners.
