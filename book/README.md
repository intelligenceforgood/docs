# Welcome
Welcome to the documentation hub for **Intelligence for Good (i4g)**, a volunteer-driven initiative incubated by [intelligence.org](https://intelligence.org/) to protect vulnerable communities from crypto and romance scams. This site consolidates the product vision, platform architecture, operating procedures, and user guidance that underpin the i4g service.

Key goals for the documentation space:

* Provide accessible guides for users, analysts, and law enforcement partners.
* Capture the end-to-end architecture and operational playbooks used to run i4g on Google Cloud.
* Document security and compliance measures that safeguard personally identifiable information (PII).
* Share the roadmap, active research questions, and avenues for community contribution.

Use the navigation menu to explore topic-specific sections. Each page links back to the originating design notes or terraform modules in the engineering repositories so contributors can cross-reference the source of truth.
