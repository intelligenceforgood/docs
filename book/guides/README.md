# User Guides

This section delivers role-specific guidance. Each guide includes workflow summaries, data-handling expectations, and screenshot placeholders you can replace with the latest UI captures before publishing.

- [User Guide](user.md) – explains how individuals submit cases safely.
- [Analyst Guide](analyst.md) – covers queue management, review best practices, and impact tracking.
- [Law Enforcement Guide](law-enforcement.md) – outlines report validation, evidence handling, and escalation.

> **Screenshot placeholders:** Look for blocks labelled “Screenshot needed”. When you have updated visuals, replace the placeholder images with captures stored in `book/assets/screenshots/` and update the captions accordingly.
