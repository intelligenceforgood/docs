# Understanding Campaigns & Governance

To effectively manage fraud intelligence, we need to look at the world through two different lenses at the same time: the **Tactical** view and the **Strategic** view.

This system is designed with two distinct tools to handle these needs: **Active Campaigns** and the **Governance Taxonomy**. This guide explains how they function and why linking them creates a more powerful intelligence workflow.

## 1. Active Campaigns (The Tactical View)

*   **Target Audience:** Analysts, Investigators, AI Models
*   **Speed:** Fast (Weekly / Daily changes)

Fraud evolves rapidly. Scammers change their scripts, switch payment methods (e.g., specific crypto wallets), and invent new hooks (e.g., "Pig Butchering").

An **Active Campaign** is a flexible, immediate "filter" that you define to catch these specific threats. It uses detailed technical signals—like specific "Intent" or "Technique" tags generated by our AI—to group cases together.

*   **Example:** "Crypto-Romance Winter 2025"
*   **Goal:** Detect and stop a specific wave of attacks happening *now*.

## 2. Governance Taxonomy (The Strategic View)

*   **Target Audience:** Executives, Policy Teams, Auditors
*   **Speed:** Stable (Quarterly / Annual updates)

While tactics change, the fundamental nature of the crime—and the policy needed to address it—remains stable. Is it Human Trafficking? Is it Financial Fraud? Policies and reporting structures rely on these stable categories to track trends over years, not days.

The **Governance Taxonomy** is a fixed hierarchical tree of high-level categories used for long-term reporting and compliance metrics.

*   **Example:** "Financial Facilitation" or "Human Trafficking > Labor Exploitation"
*   **Goal:** Consistent reporting and policy alignment over time.

## 3. Linking Them Together

The true power of the system comes when you link these two concepts. When creating a Campaign, you can associate it with a Governance Category.

This creates a "Golden Thread" that connects daily operations to high-level strategy:

1.  **Automation:** You focus on the complex, messy work of detecting specific threats (the Campaign). The system automatically "credits" those detections to the correct high-level bucket (the Taxonomy).
2.  **Agility:** You can change your detection rules every day to keep up with scammers without breaking the quarterly reports that leadership relies on.
3.  **Clarity:** Everyone speaks the same language. The specific technical wins mapped by Analysts automatically feed the correct strategic metrics viewed by Executives.

## How to use it

When configuring a Campaign in the Analyst Console:

1.  **Define your Detection Rules:** Set the technical triggers (e.g., cases containing `Intent: Romance` AND `Action: Crypto transfer`).
2.  **Select the Governance Category:** Use the **"Reporting Category"** dropdown to select the high-level home for this campaign (e.g., "Financial Facilitation").
3.  **Save:** Your campaign is now live. New cases matching your rules will be detected immediately and automatically rolled up into the strategic metrics.
