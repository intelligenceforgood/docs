# API Guide

The FastAPI gateway exposes endpoints for ingestion, case management, and reporting workflows. While access is currently limited to trusted services and authenticated analysts, documenting the API surface prepares i4g for future integrations.

- [Authentication](authentication.md) – describes IAM gating, tokens, and future plans.
- [Sample Workflows](sample-requests.md) – provides request/response examples for common tasks.

> **Sensitive operations:** Keep API documentation general enough for public reference. Detailed parameter lists and schemas remain in the private developer docs within the `core` repo (`docs/api_reference.md`, forthcoming).
