# Docs Repo — Documentation Guidelines

This repo contains documentation only. Follow the shared doc-writing rules and keep content focused.

## General
- Write clear, concise instructions using present tense and active voice.
- Organize with headings and short paragraphs.
- Include links to related architecture, deployment, or code references.

## Code Snippets
- Use short examples to demonstrate concepts; avoid pasting entire source files.
- For large files, include a one-paragraph summary plus a link to the file in the source repo.
